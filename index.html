                    <h3>March 21, 1987 - December 11, 2020</h3>
                    <p>
                        Leah was born in Seoul, Korea on March 21, 1987. She became the daughter of Bill and Dottie
                        Supulski on
                        March 21, 1988. Leah grew up in Oregon but moved to Washington, DC, which became her home. Leah
                        was
                        an
                        accomplished dancer, artist, chef, and a loving daughter and friend to many. She was very proud
                        of
                        her
                        Korean heritage, studied the language, and cooked amazing Korean food. Leah worked in many
                        fields,
                        from
                        event management to bartending. She was constantly connecting strangers, made friends easily,
                        and
                        loved
                        hosting dinner parties. In her work and in her life, Leah was the consummate host. She was
                        deeply
                        loved,
                        and
                        is dearly missed.

                        Leah was passionate about several causes - racial justice, gender equality, mental
