                    <h3>March 21, 1987 - December 11, 2020</h3>
                    <p>
                        Leah was born in Seoul, Korea on March 21, 1987. She became the daughter of Bill and Dottie
                        Supulski on March 21, 1988. Leah grew up in Oregon but moved to Washington, DC, which became her
                        home. Leah was an accomplished dancer, artist, chef, and a loving daughter and friend to many.
                        She was very proud of her Korean heritage, studied the language, and cooked amazing Korean food.
                        Leah worked
                        in many fields, from event management to bartending. She was constantly connecting strangers,
                        made
                        friends easily, and loved hosting dinner parties. In her work and in her life, Leah was the
                        consummate host. She
                        was deeply loved, and is dearly missed.
